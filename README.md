2. **Expand/collapse menu sections** by clicking on the menu row (+ to expand, - to collapse)
3. **Compare settings** across configurations - differences are highlighted in light red

5. **Edit settings** by clicking on any value cell and typing the new value
   - Press Enter to save and move to the next cell
   - Click outside the cell to save
   - Changes are automatically saved if the configuration has been previously saved to a file

## Configuration Structure

### Menu Structure

The menu structure is controlled by the `menu_structure.json` file, which defines the menus and their settings:

```json
{
  "Menu 1": ["Custom Mode", "Button Settings"],
  "Menu 2": ["Focus BKT", "ART BKT", "ISO BKT", "Drive", "C-AF Sensitivity"],
  "Menu 3": ["Live ND Shooting", "Focus Stacking", "Flicker Scan", "Face& Eye Detection"],
  "Menu 4": ["Interval Shooting", "Sequential Shooting Settings", "Subject Detection"],
  "Menu 5": ["Starry Sky AF Setting", "Noise Reduction", "Card Formatting", "AF Focus Adjustment"]
}
```

Any changes to this file will automatically update the list of settings displayed in the application.

### Configuration Data

The configuration data follows this structure:

```json
{
  "Menu 1": {
    "Custom Mode": { ... },
    "Button Settings": { ... }
  },
  "Menu 2": {
    "Focus BKT": { ... },
    "ART BKT": { ... },
    "ISO BKT": { ... },
    "Drive": { ... },
    "C-AF Sensitivity": { ... }
  },
  "Menu 3": {
    "Live ND Shooting": { ... },
    "Focus Stacking": { ... },
    "Flicker Scan": { ... },
    "Face& Eye Detection": { ... }
  },
  "Menu 4": {
    "Interval Shooting": { ... },
    "Sequential Shooting Settings": { ... },
    "Subject Detection": { ... }
  },
  "Menu 5": {
    "Starry Sky AF Setting": { ... },
    "Noise Reduction": { ... },
    "Card Formatting": { ... },
    "AF Focus Adjustment": { ... }

## Building the Executable

To build a standalone Windows executable (.exe) of the application:

1. Install development dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Create a Windows executable:
```
npm run build-win
```

3. The executable will be created in the `dist` folder.

You can also create an unpacked version of the application:
