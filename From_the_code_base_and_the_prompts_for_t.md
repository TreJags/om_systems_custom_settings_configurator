# OM-System Custom Settings Configurator - Functional Breakdown

## Application Overview
* Desktop application built with Electron for managing custom settings configurations for OM-System cameras
* Allows users to view, compare, edit, and manage multiple custom settings configurations side-by-side
* Provides a structured interface for organizing camera settings in a hierarchical menu system
* Supports persistent storage of configurations through JSON files

## Core Functionality

### Configuration Management
* **Multiple Configurations**: Display and manage four side-by-side custom settings configurations
* **Create New Configuration**: Initialize a new configuration with default settings
* **Load Configuration**: Import settings from JSON files into any of the four configuration columns
* **Save Configuration**: Export settings from any column to a JSON file
* **Auto-save**: Automatically save changes to previously saved configurations
* **Copy Settings**: Copy settings from one configuration to another or to all configurations

### User Interface
* **Side-by-side Comparison**: Four-column layout for easy comparison of different configurations
* **Nested Settings Structure**: Hierarchical organization of settings in expandable/collapsible menus
* **Difference Highlighting**: Automatic highlighting of settings that differ across configurations
* **Expandable Rows**: Toggle visibility of settings under each menu category
* **Expand/Collapse All**: Controls to expand or collapse all menu sections at once
* **Column Selection**: Click to select a specific configuration column for operations
* **Configuration Section Toggle**: Option to hide/show the configuration selection area

### Settings Editing
* **Direct Editing**: Edit settings values directly in the table cells
* **Radio Button Selection**: Select from predefined options using radio buttons
* **Keyboard Navigation**: Use Enter key to save and move to the next editable cell
* **Visual Feedback**: Highlight edited cells and selected radio options

### Data Persistence
* **JSON File Storage**: Save and load configurations as JSON files
* **Local Storage**: Remember UI state (expanded/collapsed sections) between sessions
* **File Path Tracking**: Keep track of file paths for auto-saving changes

## Technical Architecture

### Application Structure
* **Main Process** (main.js):
  * Application lifecycle management
  * Window creation and management
  * File system operations (load/save configurations)
  * IPC communication handling
  * Menu structure loading

* **Renderer Process** (renderer.js):
  * UI event handling
  * Configuration data management
  * Dynamic table generation
  * Settings comparison and highlighting
  * Auto-save functionality

* **Preload Script** (preload.js):
  * Secure bridge between renderer and main processes
  * Exposes limited API for IPC communication

* **HTML/CSS** (index.html):
  * Application layout and styling
  * Table structure for settings display
  * Control elements (buttons, dropdowns)

### Data Structure
* **Menu Structure** (menu_structure.json):
  * Hierarchical organization of settings categories
  * Definition of available options for each setting
  * Support for nested settings up to three levels deep

* **Configuration Data**:
  * JSON objects representing camera settings
  * Organized by menu categories and setting names
  * Support for various data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects)

### Communication Flow
* **IPC Communication**:
  * Renderer to Main: Request file operations, get default config, get menu structure
  * Main to Renderer: Return operation results, configuration data

* **Event-driven Architecture**:
  * DOM events for user interactions
  * Custom events for application state changes

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
* Display four side-by-side configuration columns
* Support nested menu structure with expandable/collapsible rows
* Highlight differences between configurations
* Allow direct editing of settings values
* Support loading/saving configurations from/to JSON files
* Enable copying settings between configurations
* Provide auto-save functionality
* Remember UI state between sessions

### Technical Requirements
* Electron-based desktop application
* Cross-platform compatibility (focus on Windows)
* JSON-based data storage
* Responsive and intuitive user interface
* Efficient handling of configuration data
* Secure IPC communication between processes

### User Requirements
* Simple and intuitive interface for managing camera settings
* Easy comparison of different configurations
* Quick editing of settings values
* Persistent storage of configurations
* Visual feedback for differences and changes

## Implementation Details

### Technologies Used
* **Electron**: Cross-platform desktop application framework
* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend UI and logic
* **Node.js**: Backend functionality and file system operations
* **electron-store**: Persistent storage for application state
* **JSON**: Data format for configuration storage

### Key Components
* **Configuration Manager**: Handles loading, saving, and managing configuration data
* **UI Renderer**: Dynamically generates and updates the settings table
* **Event Handler**: Manages user interactions and application events
* **File System Interface**: Handles reading from and writing to JSON files
* **IPC Bridge**: Facilitates communication between main and renderer processes

### Security Considerations
* Context isolation between processes
* Limited API exposure through preload script
* Validation of user inputs and file contents
* Error handling for file operations and data parsing

## Future Enhancements
* Support for additional camera models and settings
* Import/export of settings to/from camera directly
* Configuration templates and presets
* Search and filter functionality for settings
* Backup and version history for configurations
* Dark mode and additional UI themes
* Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
* Multi-language support
